# Desktop Cleaner

Desktop Cleaner is a utility designed to help keep your desktop clean and organized. It automatically moves files from your desktop to designated folders based on their file types.

## Features

- **Automatic File Organization:** Desktop Cleaner monitors your desktop for new files and automatically moves them to the appropriate folders based on their file types. For example, image files go to the "Images" folder, documents go to the "Documents" folder, and so on.

- **Customizable Rules:** You can customize the file organization rules to suit your needs. Want all your PDF files in a separate "PDF" folder? No problem! Desktop Cleaner lets you specify which file types go to which folders.

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Desktop Cleaner runs in the background and continuously monitors your desktop for new files. No need to manually trigger the file organization process.
